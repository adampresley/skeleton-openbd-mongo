# Skeleton OpenBD + MongoDB

This is a skeleton setup for building an application in OpenBD CFML and MongoDB on top
of Tomcat. The stack is as follows:

* Apache Tomcat 7.0.25
* MongoDB 2.0.3 for Linux 64-bit
* OpenBD 2.0.2

Right now this stack only really work on a Linux based platform. I do have plans on including the
Windows version of MongoDB, and Windows-based start and stop scripts as well.

Free. I didn't write any of this anyway. Just the start and stop scripts... but...
